	<h1>About LMC</h1>
    <p>Founded in 2004, LMC Construction is young by some standards. When it comes to industry experience though, our staff has more than 250 years under its belt. </p>
    <p>It’s this combination of youth and wisdom that gives us—and our clients—a real competitive advantage. We know how to get things done, but we’re not tied to one way of doing things. Instead, we embrace new ideas and diverse opinions, especially when they come together to improve quality and lower costs.</p>
    
     <h2>Approachable and Available</h2>
     <p>Our company executives believe in working side-by-side with everyone on a project team, especially in the pre-construction and estimating stages. This sets a standard for how all of us do business with our clients. For example, our project managers not only oversee construction, they’re also involved in cost estimating and scope development and value engineering. We’re able to make decisions quickly and confidently, and we’re always available when our clients need us. As a result, most of our work is negotiated and comes from repeat customers.</p>
     
     <h2>Team-Oriented</h2>
     <p>At our core, we’re committed to forging strong bonds with everyone in the construction process—whether it’s the most prominent state architects or agencies like OHCS and USAD Rural Development. We value everyone’s input and experience. That carries over to how we manage our own teams too. Since we subcontract 95% of our work, we’re able to assemble the best project team for every job we manage.</p>
