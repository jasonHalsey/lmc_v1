	<h1>LMC Services</h1>
    <h2>Affordable Housing</h2>
    <p>We believe in helping our neighbors put down roots in places they can call home. As housing and rental rates climb, that’s becoming a difficult dream for many to achieve. By partnering with state housing agencies and nonprofits, we’re able to help more people find a home of their own.</p> 

	<p>We specialize in developing, building and renovating high-quality affordable housing that endures. Our consultative approach allows us to partner with a project team early in the process, finding ways to minimize building costs.  We’re accustomed to meeting tight deadlines and budgets, even in the face of ongoing scope changes. For renovations, we take great care to minimize the impact on existing tenants, while staying within a project’s scope.</p>
    
    <div id="housing" class="floatright"><div id="pull_1" class="pullquote">“CASA has worked on several projects with LMC. LMC has done an excellent job on both new construction and substantial rehabilitation projects. In addition to handling the actual construction well, LMC has been helpful in suggesting ways to minimize the construction costs and in suggesting effective solutions to unforeseen problems that arise during construction. 

Just as important, LMC is familiar with and is willing to work with the variety of federal and state funding sources used in affordable housing development.”
<p class="pullquote"><b>-- Charlie Harris, housing program manager, CASA of Oregon</b></p></div></div>
    
     <h2>New Construction</h2>
     <p>Our new construction portfolio spans residential and commercial properties, from apartment buildings to shopping centers. We self perform some punch work and select finish carpentry, but rely on a talent pool of trusted and specialized subcontractors for most of the project work.</p> 

<p>We follow the highest quality and safety standards, employing an onsite superintendent who oversees every detail and files daily construction reports. By keeping everyone in the loop at all phases of a project, we can address problems and changes immediately. This allows us to come in on time and on budget time and again.</p>

	<h2>Renovations</h2>
    <p>Since 2004, we have completed more than 1,625 units of renovation work, most of which has come from repeat clients. Our expertise in multi-family renovations is sought after by leading developers and housing agencies in Oregon and Washington.</p> 

	<p>Our staff understands and respects the complexities involved with renovating occupied dwellings. Often we’re asked to complete extensive interior renovations around residents’ schedules and needs. Other times, we work with property managers on site to temporarily relocate residents.</p>
    
    <h2>Tenant Improvements</h2>
    <p>When it comes to upgrading existing spaces, we know that time is of the essence. We have experience with a broad variety of building improvements, from cosmetic to structural. Our goal is to ensure fast turnaround and premium quality.</p>
    
    <h2>Pre-construction</h2>
    <p>We provide pre-construction services on all our projects. Getting involved from the get-go helps us ensure each project comes in on time and on budget. A dedicated project manager attends every meeting necessary, and our company principals are available to help with critical needs assessments, scope development and cost estimating. We can provide historical data, input on subcontractors and hard pricing to make sure each project gets off to a strong start.</p>
     
    <h2>Construction Management</h2>
    <p>We subcontract most of our work so that we can devote our resources to ensuring the best project outcomes for our clients. That means staying on top of every detail from pre-planning to post-construction. We consider ourselves an extension of our clients’ teams, helping them with a range of services, including:
    <ul class="contentList">
        <li>Researching and evaluating funding resources</li>
        <li>Defining and controlling project scope</li>
        <li>Scheduling projects</li>
        <li>Procuring and managing labor</li>
        <li>Procuring and managing materials</li>
        <li>Overseeing budgets</li>
	</ul></p>

    <h2>Green Building</h2>
    <div id="green" class="sustainfloat"></div><p>At LMC, sustainability is more than a practice; it’s a mindset. We are experts at pursuing affordable housing energy credits for features like windows, appliances, fixtures, water heaters and insulation. We also have several employees in the process of becoming LEED<sup>&reg;</sup> accredited, expanding on our commitment to green building practices.</p>
    
    <p>At the onset of each project, we meet with local disposal companies to minimize waste and coordinate recycling activities. We work with salvage companies, liquidators and charity organizations to ensure what we demolish is recycled and reused as much as possible.</p>
